            <p>  Hello, my name is Thomas Correia. I graduating in May of 2019 history major and PWTC student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  My academic pursuit in history is linked to inspirations from my fatherâ€™s passion for history when I was a child, as well as a number of very positive experiences with my high school history teachers.  As a result, the career path which I am pursuing is becoming a high school history teacher.</p>
            
            <p>In my final semester at UMass Amherst I have acquired a position as a student tutor in the Academic Achievement Center at Amherst-Pelham Regional High School.  This position is a wonderful opportunity to explore the world of teaching and is allowing me to develop interpersonal skills between teacher and student.  Some of my academic passions include scholarly research paper, of which I have had one published by the UMass Amherst History Journal, anthropology readings, and the study of revolutions.  These passions combined with the professional experience I am gaining as a student tutor is preparing me to become a model teacher and mentor for future students.</p>

            <p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also an avid fan of martial arts and sports.  As a child I participated in baseball, football, and basketball.  My effort and determination allowed me to become a captain on my high school baseball and football teams.  At sixteen I changed my athletic experience from traditional American sports to combat sports.  I began training Muy Thai, an old standing martial art originating in Thailand, as well as western boxing and kick boxing.  After coming to UMass Amherst, was exposed to the opportunity to compete at the collegiate level in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a non-striking sport best explained as a combination of Greco-Roman wrestling and submissions.  Staying in shape and continuing to build my knowledge in martial arts is a pure passion of mine and I have found great benefits to my mental and physical health.  Through this community, I have come to learn much about nutrition, stretching, exercise, meditation, and overall human optimization. </p>
