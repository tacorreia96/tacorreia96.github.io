        <h1>Angela's Cakes</h1>
    <p> Angela Corriea has been making and designing cakes for over 16 years now. starting off by offering up her skills to family events like birthday parties, weddings, and holidays, Angela has since become a bit of a master cake decorator.  She has been a lead cake designer at three bakeries in Massachusetts. Now, for the first time, her skills and artistic abilities are available to the general public. She only has a personal instagram where she sometimes features her cake creations, but this website would allow for an "about me" page, a portfolio of all her cake creations, a pricing page, and a contact page. </p>

        <h1>Mendes Martial Arts</h1>
    <p> Mendes Martial Arts is where I learned American-kickboxing from Greg Mendes.  He currently employs a facebook page for his business but I feel that a website would add a professional feeling to his MMA School. The site would feature a history of the company page, a list of available classes page, a gallery page, a merchandise page, and a contact page. </p>

        <h1>Randy's Cigar Shop</h1>
    <p>My Uncle Randy owns a cigar shop in the Attleboro, MA area. He has no website or online presence so this website would actually be useful to his business. The website would be composed of 4 pages: an about the business page, a gallerey page displaying his store, a list of featured merchandise, and a contact page.</p>
