            <p>  Hello, my name is Thomas Correia. I will be a 2019 history major and PWTC graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  My academic pursuit in history is linked to inspirations from my fatherâ€™s passion for history when I was a child, as well as a number of very positive experiences with my high school history teachers.  As a result, I am on the path to becoming a high school history teacher.</p>
            
            <p>In my final semester at UMass Amherst I have acquired a position as a student tutor in the Academic Achievement Center at Amherst-Pelham Regional High School.  This position is a wonderful opportunity to explore the world of teaching and is allowing me to develop interpersonal skills between teacher and student.  Some of my academic passions include academic writings, of which I have one published by the UMass Amherst History Journal, anthropology readings, and the study of revolutions.  </p>

            <p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also an avid fan of<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"> martial arts</a> and sports.  As a child I participated in baseball, football, and basketball. I became a captain on my high school baseball and football teams.  At sixteen I changed my athletic experience from traditional American sports to combat sports.  I began training Muy Thai, western boxing, and kick boxing.  After coming to UMass Amherst, I started to compete in collegiate level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Staying in shape and continuing to build my knowledge in martial arts is a pure passion of mine and I have found great benefits to my mental and physical health. </p>
